# SQL-Resume-Project
The purpose of this project is to display my understanding of SQL after independent study over Summer 2023. 

The SQL queries I have written were used to analyze mock datasets for a bike company. 

The SQL Queries I've written are grouped by 3 analyses: Sales Performance, Customer Segmentation, and Product Performance

The SQL queries file contains the queries I've written. 

SQL Queries are grouped by 3 analyses: Sales Performance, Customer Segmentation, and Product Performance

Additonally, here is a link to a Sales Performance Dashboard that visualizes the Bike Company Data
