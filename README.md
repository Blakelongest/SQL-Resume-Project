# SQL/Tableau-Analysis of Bike Company Mock Datasets
The purpose of this project is to display my understanding of SQL after independent study over Summer 2023. 

The SQL queries I have written were used to analyze mock datasets for a bike company, and these data sets are located within "BikeCompanyMockdatasets(2).xls". 
The SQL Queries I've written are grouped by 3 analyses (Sales Performance, Customer Segmentation, Product Performance), and are located within "SQLqueries.sql". 

Additonally, here is a link to a Sales Performance Dashboard I've created in Tableau to visualizes the same Bike Company Data used in my SQL analysis. 
- Please select a Continent(s), Country(ies), and Timeframe at the top of dashboard for analysis.
