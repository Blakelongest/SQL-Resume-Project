# SQL-Resume-Project
The purpose of this project is to display my understanding of SQL after independent study over Summer 2023. 

The SQL queries I have written were used to analyze mock datasets for a bike company, and these data sets are located within "BikeCompanyMockdatasets(2).xls". 
The SQL Queries I've written are grouped by 3 analyses (Sales Performance, Customer Segmentation, and Product Performance), and are located within "SQLqueries.sql". 

Additonally, here is a link to a Sales Performance Dashboard that visualizes the Bike Company Data
